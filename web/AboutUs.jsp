Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as relationships with their members. Library management systems help libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts.

Library management systems also involve maintaining the database for entering new books and recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates.</h3>

        <ol type="I">
            <li>Any library member should be able to search books by their Book id, Book and Author name, department and subject  category.</l1>
            <li>Each book will have a unique identification number.</li>
            <li>There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy of a book, a book item.</li>
            <li>The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.
